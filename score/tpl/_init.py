    Initializes this module acoording to :ref:`our module initialization
    guidelines <module_initialization>` with the following configuration keys:

    :confkey:`rootdir` :faint:`[default=None]`
        Denotes the root folder containing all templates. When a new format is
        created via :meth:`.Renderer.register_format`, it will have a
        sub-folder of this folder as its default root (unless, of course, the
        `rootdir` parameter of that function is provided). If this value is
        omitted, all calls to :meth:`.Renderer.register_format` must provide a
        format-specific root folder.

    :confkey:`cachedir` :faint:`[default=None]`
        A cache folder that will be used to cache rendered templates. Will
        fall back to a sub-folder (called ``tpl``) of the cachedir in the
        *webassets*, if one was provided.

        Although this module will work without a cache folder, it is highly
        recommended that it is either initialized with a ``cachedir`` or a
        *webassets* with a valid ``cachedir``, even if the value points
        to the system's temporary folder.

    :confkey:`default_format` :faint:`[default=None]`
        The default format of files where the :term:`template format` could
        not be determined automatically. This must be the name of another,
        registered format.

    :confkey:`engine.*`
        All keys starting with ``engine.`` will be registered as engines. For
        example, if the key ``engine.php`` is provided, the engine will be
        instantiated via :func:`score.init.init_object` and registered for the
        extension ``php``.
